# DSE1101 Project

 This project is done as part of an introductory data science course DSE1101 Data Science for Economics. The course aimed to introduce the very basics of the various common machine learning methods and how they can be applied in R. The course culminated in a project where students could choose between 4 real world datasets and build predictive models using the techniques learnt in this course.
